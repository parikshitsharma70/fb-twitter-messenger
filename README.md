# fb-twitter-messenger v 1.0.0

This is an implementation in Python to connect Facebook Messenger to Twitter DMs in order to forward your messages.

Right now all it does is fetches the latest message from your FaceBook account, and forwards it from your Twitter account to a pre-specified Twitter account recipient ID.
